"""Function for the gobble trick card

Take 7 treats
THEN
Return 1 treat for each spot in your highest unfilled space

(suggestion: maybe do a set intersection of the cards' required dice and 
fulfilled dice and then list sorting to return the highest overall required dice
from a list of all the uncompleted cards the player has)
