Functions:

Trick functions: (each trick should have a means of tracking if it has a treat on it for the next player that selects it)
    Chase (nest dice roll, prompt to spend a treat if available, and placement functions)
    Fetch (nest dice roll, prompt to spend a treat if available, and placement functions)
    Gobble
    Howl(nest deal, dice roll, prompt to spend a treat if available, and placement functions)
    Roll Over (nest dice roll, prompt to spend a treat if available, and placement functions)
    Trot (nest dice roll, prompt to spend a treat if available, and placement functions)

Dice placement - take list of rolled dice and prompt the player to select which
                applicable dog card they want to place it on 
                Any remaining dice must be placed in the player's yard
                bust function

Roll function

Bust function - check for bust (if yard > 7)
                if True clear all active cards and yard

Trick Tracker - track which Tricks are active/inactive;
                once only one trick is remaining active "place" a treat on that 
                trick for the next player who selects that trick;
                reset all tricks to active

                (Don't know if it would be easiest to have each trick as a class
                with maybe an active/inactive attribute in the init function?
                Open to different suggestions)

complete_card function - moves the fulfilled card from the active card list to
                        the completed card list 
                        deals a new card to the player if they have less than 6 cards

game setup - prompting player count;
            creating Player class objects;
            determining player order

turn function - in the Spots file
                order of turn actions;
                prompting the player what they want to do with their turn
                    (active trick list, complete a card if applicable)
                call relevant trick or card completion function
                    mark called trick as inactive
                check if all cards are complete
                    (if all cards completed in one turn they automatically count 
                    as completed instead of the player having to spend their turn
                    completing the fulfilled card)
                    use Counter method to compare req_dice and fulfilled_dice due
                        possible duplicate values (set intersection would not work)
                Score check (once one player completes 6 cards they win)
                
Magic Methods: (for each class)

BUGS:
- Tricks are not refreshing when only one trick remains
            
NOTES:
- Can we delete AurdosFP1.py and trick_tracker.py files?
- There seem to be some unused imports in our Spots file, can we get rid of those?
- We need to write our README and annotated bibliography (info in the final project description in canvas)
- Need to add if __name__ == "__main__"
